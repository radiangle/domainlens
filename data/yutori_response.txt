### Stainless steel defects: causes, ranges, tests, prevention

I compiled a concise technical reference on four stainless steel metallurgy
defects with causes, temperature ranges, testing standards, and prevention
methods. Sources are cited inline. 

**1) Sensitization.** Precipitation of chromium-rich carbides at grain
  boundaries depletes adjacent chromium below the critical level when exposed
  within the sensitization range during welding or heat treatment. [1]
- **Temperature ranges:** Formation 550°C–850°C (often cited 500–800°C).
  Prevention: keep below 425°C or rapidly cool; solution anneal 1050–1100°C then
  rapid quench. [1]
- **Testing standards:** ASTM A262 (Practices A, B, C, E, F); ASTM A923; ISO
  3651-2. [1]
- **Prevention:** Low-carbon grades (304L, 316L); Ti/Nb-stabilized grades (321,
  347); solution anneal and rapid quench; fast cooling during welding/heat
  treatment. [1]

**2) SCC (stress corrosion cracking).** Requires susceptible material, corrosive
  environment (often chlorides or caustics), and tensile stress; often initiates
  at pits then propagates brittlely. [1]
- **Temperature ranges:** Typically above 100°C; commonly tested at 155°C; can
  occur as low as 55°C in highly oxidizing conditions for duplex stainless
  steels. Prevention targets: below 50°C in chloride environments; below 100°C
  generally. [1]
- **Testing standards:** ASTM G36, G129, G39, G123; NACE MR0175/ISO 15156. [1]
- **Prevention:** Material upgrades (duplex 2205, 2507; super austenitics 254
  SMO, AL-6XN); stress relief/PWHT; control chlorides, pH, temperature;
  protective coatings; cathodic protection. [1]

**3) Pitting.** Passive film breakdown by chlorides at weak sites (e.g., MnS
  inclusions) creates active pits with acidic, concentrated chloride chemistry.
  [1]
- **Temperature ranges:** Risk increases with temperature; CPT varies by alloy
  (~10°C to 85°C+). Examples: 316L ~20–25°C in seawater; 254 SMO ~65°C.
  Prevention: operate below alloy CPT (often 30–40°C for standard grades in
  chlorides). [1]
- **Testing standards:** ASTM G48 (Methods E, F for CPT/CCT), ASTM G150, ASTM
  G61. [1]
- **Prevention:** Higher-PREN alloys (e.g., 316L, 2205, 254 SMO); smooth
  finishes; reduce chlorides, lower temperature, raise pH; inhibitors; cathodic
  protection. [1]

**4) PASCC (polythionic acid SCC).** Affects sensitized austenitic stainless
  steels and some nickel alloys when polythionic acids form from sulfur compounds
  with moisture and oxygen, attacking chromium-depleted grain boundaries—often
  during shutdowns. [1]
- **Temperature ranges:** Sensitization 370°C–815°C; cracking at ~20–100°C
  during shutdowns when moisture and oxygen are present. Prevention: avoid
  sensitization; maintain dry, sulfur-free shutdown conditions. [1]
- **Testing standards:** ASTM G35 (room temperature 22–25°C); NACE MR0175/ISO
  15156. [1]
- **Prevention:** Low-carbon or stabilized grades; solution anneal PWHT; water
  flush then neutralize with sodium bicarbonate/carbonate; keep equipment dry;
  inert gas blanketing (nitrogen purge). [1]
